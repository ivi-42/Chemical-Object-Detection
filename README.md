
This is a chemical_object_detection model trained to distiguish singular chemical reactions based on unique behaviours.

it tries to detect 
['oscillatingch', 'xlmetalpot', 'merall', 'unstableox']

Oscillating chemical reactions = oscillatingch

liquid metal explosive = xmetalpot

mercury and alluminium reactions = merall

unstable oxidizer = unstableox


This is a work in progress, and I am utilizing my own machine that is not extremely powerful, when i'll have better equipment i'll update the results

This model is based out of SSD MobileNet V2 FPNLite 320x320, due to it's good compromise between speed and performance
