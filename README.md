
This is a chemical_object_detection model trained to distiguish singular chemical reactions based on unique behaviours.

it tries to detect 
['oscillatingch', 'xlmetalpot', 'merall', 'unstableox']

Oscillating chemical reactions = oscillatingch

liquid metal explosive = xmetalpot

mercury and alluminium reactions = merall

unstable oxidizer = unstableox
